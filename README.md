##### People like me are sometime confused about their actual age or how old they are, yes we do exist. So to solve this stupid confusion here is the stupid solution.
## CharDin is a web application which calculates your age.
### takes your birth date (hope you remember that atleast0) as input and tells you how old you are, number of months and days you spent until now.
